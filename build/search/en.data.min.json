A knowledge inventory is a systematic cataloging of the knowledge currently retained within an organization (e.g., planetary science) and can be used to identify gaps that can or should be filled (e.g., a missing product to support an upcoming scientific investigation or mission), or as an enumerated listing of data to include in a data portal. The collection of information about these foundational data products seeks to democratize their use and make them significantly more findable than previously known.\nA key component to use foundational data product is understanding their spatial efficacy. Spatial efficacy describes the ability for a data product to provide the intended results. Spatial efficacy varies by use case as different products have metadata attributes (e.g., spatial resolution) that are suitable for different analyses. Quantitative and qualitative metadata fields are defined and described in the metadata section of this site.\nOne of the challenges initially creating this knowledge inventory was data discoverability. Despite these best efforts, the planetary sciences do not have a single, unified data clearinghouse or single major journal where data products are described upon release. Therefore, significant effort is required to identify products. The data section is organized by major body (e.g., Mars and associated satellites Phobos and Deimos) and presents metadata describing each data product in tabular form. The metadata are not necessarily complete for each entry, but a best effort has been performed to initially collate this information.\nThis best effort has consisted of combing the literature and data stores (e.g., the Planetary Data System (PDS) or international PDS like data archives, personal publicly available websites and blogs, etc.) for descriptions of data. The initial listing was then reviewed by members of the Mapping and Spatial Data Infrastructure Team and peer reviewed in the paper Knowledge Inventory of Foundational Data Products in Planetary Science.\nThe peer reviewed paper linked above is a snapshot of the current state of foundational data products to the best of our knowledge and was, unfortunately, undoubtedly out of date by the time the work was published. Data producers work diligently to create and release products at a cadence far faster than addendum could be published in the peer reviewed literature. Hence, the existence of this site!\nThis site is dependent upon data producers, data users, and the interested public to crowd source keeping the knowledge inventory up to date. The contributing section of the site describes means to contribute updates to existing entries, new entries, and provides links to places to discuss entries.\nFuture Improvements This knowledge inventory currently only covers foundational data products. In reality, an entire universe of framework data products also exist. As Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructures are developed users will require a combination of discoverable foundational and framework data products in order to effectively carry out their engineering and scientific investigations. The first step in making those data FAIRly available is to know that they exist. This effort will, in the future, include framework products as well to help bootstrap the creation of centralized data clearinghouse and PSDIs.\nFoundational Data Products Foundational data products meet two criteria as defined by Laura \u0026amp; Beyer (2021).\nFoundational data products fall into one of three data type categories: geodetic coordinate reference frames, topography, and orthoimages. These data are widely used either directly or a second-order products by a wide subset of the planetary science community. A second-order user is someone who uses a data product (e.g., a geologic map) whose generation requires extensive use of foundational data products (e.g., topography and orthoimages or orthomosaics in the case of a geologic map.) Foundational data products must facilitate or allow for rigorous spatial error assessment and reporting. In other words, the data must be suitable for performing an error assessment, must have had an error assessment performed, and must have the results published somewhere. To be suitable for performing a rigorous spatial error assessment data should be minimally interpolated and rigorously geometrically controlled. Perhaps the best way to make this requirement clear is with an example. Orthoimages created from photogrammetrically controlled image data and tied to cross-over corrected lidar (e.g., Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)) are the only products that are rigorously transformed from direct observations into a geospatial context that maintains accurate of all spatial relationships. Therefore, one can directly compute and report the accuracy of the products.\nThe knowledge inventory presented on this site contains the best available foundational data products. The bar to meet the second criteria is quite high and in some cases unachievable given the currently available data. We do not consider this a problem as one of the stated goals of this knowledge inventory is to present gaps that can be filled by data producers. Therefore, foundational data products are presented with unknown spatial errors, alignment to best fit spheres or ellipsoids when ideally geoids would be used, etc. A best effort is made to document these instances.\nCiting this work If you use information from this website in your work, please consider citing Knowledge Inventory of Foundational Data Products in Planetary Science.\n@article{Laura_2021, Abstract = {Some of the key components of any Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructure (PDSI) are the data products that end-users wish to discover, access, and interrogate. One precursor to the implementation of a PSDI is a knowledge inventory that catalogs what products are available, from which data producers, and at what initially understood data qualities. We present a knowledge inventory of foundational PSDI data products: geodetic coordinate reference frames, elevation or topography, and orthoimages or orthomosaics. Additionally, we catalog the available gravity models that serve as critical data for the assessment of spatial location, spatial accuracy, and ultimately spatial efficacy. We strengthen our previously published definitions of foundational data products to assist in solidifying a common vocabulary that will improve communication about these essential data products.}, Author = {Laura, Jason R. and Beyer, Ross A.}, Doi = {10.3847/psj/abcb94}, Journal = {The Planetary Science Journal}, Month = {jan}, Number = {1}, Pages = {18}, Publisher = {American Astronomical Society}, Title = {Knowledge Inventory of Foundational Data Products in Planetary Science}, Url = {https://doi.org/10.3847/psj/abcb94}, Volume = {2}, Year = 2021, Bdsk-Url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.3847/psj/abcb94}} "},{"id":4,"href":"/fdp/venus/","title":"Venus","parent":"Foundational Data Products","content":" Product Name Product Type Horizontal Accuracy Vertical Accuracy Resolution Coverage Status Offline Formats Online Formats Source/Producer Data Provider References Magellan MGNP180U Gravity NA NA 1ppd Near Global Current [\u0026#39;DAT\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;IMG\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;?\u0026#39;] JPL PDS [\u0026#39;Konopliv:1999icarus\u0026#39;] Magellan SAR Altimeter Elevation ? 50m 22ppd / 5kmpp Near Global Current [\u0026#39;IMG\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;GeoTiff\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;WMS\u0026#39;] USGS PDS, USGS [\u0026#39;Ford:1992jgr\u0026#39;] Magellan SAR Regional Stereo DEMs Elevation ? ? ~500mpp Regional Current [\u0026#39;GeoTiff\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;?\u0026#39;] Herrick, et al.

Each page contains a table where every row is a different product.\nWarning\nIn the initial release of this site, the references and links to online data are static (i.e., they do not work). In future updates, we will be making the reference links live to appropriate publisher websites and making links to the data available (largely from the cited works). We appreciate your patience while we update that information for this living knowledge inventory.\nFoundational data products:\nGeodetic Coordinate Reference Frame (or Proxy) defines the reference frame to which all other products are referenced and is required in order to communicate the precise location of objects or places in relation to one another. Elevation products describe (ideally) the orthometric heights of objects or locations about some agreed upon vertical datum (or vertical reference frame). Orthoimages are geometrically corrected (to topography) data sets that are planimetrically corrected and usable for accurately measuring shapes, distances, and angles. Note\nSee Laura \u0026amp; Beyer (2021) for an in-depth discussion, appropriate citations for each of these foundational data products types, and for a full discussion of Image Mosaics and other by-products of foundational data products.\nImage Mosaics Image mosaics are not foundational data products. Image mosaics are widely used and this inventory includes some image mosaics because of their high usability and importance as convenience products when performing analyses. The table below can be used to determine if an image mosaic has been created from foundational data products. If it has (a \u0026lsquo;Yes\u0026rsquo; in the first column), the data product can be used in the same way that a foundational data product could be used. In other words, an orthoimage is a foundational data product. An orthomosaic created from foundational orthoimages is a second-order foundational data product and meets the same appropriateness for use criteria.\nGeodetic Control (or just Control): Image mosaics can be controlled, semi-controlled, or uncontrolled. In order to classify as a controlled mosaic, the sensor positions and orientations of multiple images must have been updated using a rigorous photogrammetric bundle adjustment. Semi-controlled mosaics can be created by taking the initial, estimated geographic position, and then warping (rubber sheeting or georeferencing) the images on the surface into a position where discontinuities between images are minimized. The resulting products are generally visually quite appealing but have a limited capacity for spatial accuracy assessment and are unsuitable for cross-product error analysis or co-registration with a spatial accuracy requirement. Finally, uncontrolled image mosaics use the initial, estimated geographic location of the images on the surface without any correction for inter-image discontinuities. Uncontrolled image mosaics are well suited for a first look at a geographic region, but care must be taken as the image locations within the scene are approximate.\nReference Frame: A controlled (or semi-controlled) mosaic can be related to the reference frame either relatively or absolutely. A relatively controlled image mosaic \u0026ldquo;floats\u0026rdquo; above the geodetic coordinate reference frame and has not been tied to the broader geospatial context. We considered those relatively controlled mosaics where a single ground point (a known latitude and longitude) has been used to \u0026ldquo;tack\u0026rdquo; the mosaic to the surface as still floating. An absolutely controlled image mosaic has been rigorously tied to a geodetic coordinate reference frame. Therefore, intra-data set evaluations (assuming both products are controlled to the same coordinate reference frame) are possible.\nRectification: The level of rectification applied to the images in the image mosaic also defines the fitness for use. As described above, unrectified images are in a perspective view that suffers from sensor-orientation- and topography-induced errors. Orthorectified images have been topographically corrected for a planimetric view. A rigorously controlled image mosaic that has been rectified to a spherical body representation can suffer from significant topography-induced errors that cannot be removed simply by controlling the data, and we do not consider such an image or mosaic to be orthorectified without topographic information.\nIntended Use: Image mosaics can be classified based upon the way in which the individual pixels or digital number (DN) values are being reported. We classify these as either being qualitative or quantitative.\nFDP Control Reference Frame Orthorectified Intended Use Fit-for-Use No Uncontrolled N/A No Cosmetic Quick view, not geospatial, errors not quantified Science Yes Cosmetic Science Semi-Controlled Relative No Cosmetic Regional Work, Small Scale (1:500,000+), spatial errors can be meaningful and a product of multiple factors Science Yes Cosmetic Science Absolute No Cosmetic Regional Work, Small Scale (1:500,000+), spatial errors can be meaningful and a product of multiple factors, cross instrument errors can be compounding Science Yes Cosmetic Regional Work, Small Scale (1:500,000+), spatial errors can be meaningful, cross instrument errors can be compounding Science Controlled Relative No Cosmetic Geospatially enabled, spatial errors can be meaningful, cross instrument work is not possible, inter-data set geometric relationships are clean Science Yes Cosmetic Geospatially enabled, cross instrument work is not possible, inter-data set geometric relationships are clean Science Absolute No Cosmetic Geospatially enabled, cross instrument work possible, geometric relationships are inaccurate Science Yes Yes Cosmetic Fully geospatially enabled, spatial errors are quantifiable, cross instrument work possible, change detection possible Science "},{"id":15,"href":"/contributing/","title":"Contributing","parent":"Welcome to the Foundational Data Products Knowledge Inventory","content":" Contributing There are many ways to be part of the community that is building around [analysis ready data] for the planetary sciences and planetary spatial data infrastructures. We want to make contributing as easy as possible, engage as many users as possible, share what we know, and learn about the myriad of products we do not know about.\nThe data presented on this site are stored in here in a code repository on GitHub. Data are stored on GitHub to maintain the lineage of changes, to provide a place for anyone to submit new entries, and finally to have a conversation about one or more data sets. We hope that using a code repository is not an undue burden to potential contributors, but understand that for a new user, making use of a new website can be daunting. If that is the case, please feel free to email jlaura@usgs.gov with your contribution, and they will get an issue, pull request, or discussion started over on the GitHub repository.\nThere are many ways to contribute as alluded to above:\nOpen an issue. This is a great way to suggest a new product or to identify a specific problem with an entry. Browse or start a new discussion. This is a great way to ask a question or start a conversation with the other community members about adding a new product, modifying an existing entry, or seeking clarification about something. Open a pull request with a change. This is how the community tracks changes in the knowledge inventory and this process means that changes to the inventory are being peer-reviewed by maintainers. As above, if you want to participate and are finding the process too burdensome, please email jlaura@usgs.gov with your contribution.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Welcome to the Foundational Data Products Knowledge Inventory","content":""}]
