Qualitative metadata are those metadata that are free form and not readily verified as being factual or not. For example, a textual description of the data product or a textual summary describing the fitness-of-use for a particular data set. This contrasts quantitative metadata such as the data product name or the vertical accuracy, both of which are factually provable.

At this time, we have not identified any qualitative metadata because we do not see this type of metadata being described by data producers. We hope, moving forward, that we can begin to build a corpus of qualitative metadata to support increased discovery and safe use of these data products.
