	Abstract = {JPL's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) has primary responsibility for design and implementation of the \{SPICE\} ancillary information system, supporting a wide range of space science mission design, observation planning and data analysis functions. \{NAIF\} also serves as the ancillary data node of the Planetary Data System (PDS). As part of the PDS, \{NAIF\} archives \{SPICE\} and other ancillary data produced by flight projects. \{NAIF\} then distributes these data, and associated data access software and high-level tools, free of charge, to researchers funded by NASA's Office of Space Science, and to the broader space science community to the extent \{NAIF\} resources and \{NASA\} and \{JPL\} policy permit. This paper describes the \{SPICE\} system, identifies current and future \{SPICE\} applications, and summarizes customer support offered by NAIF. This information is current as of Spring 1995. },

abstract = {The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was placed into Mars orbit on September 11, 1997, and by March 9, 1999, had slowly circularized through aerobraking to a Sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with an average altitude of 378 km. The science payload includes the Mars Orbiter Camera, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, Thermal Emission Spectrometer, Ultrastable Oscillator (for Radio Science experiments), and Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer package. In addition, the spacecraft accelerometers and horizon sensors were used to study atmospheric dynamics during aerobraking. Observations are processed to standard products by the instrument teams and released as documented archive volumes on 6-month centers by the Planetary Data System. Significant results have been obtained from observations of the interior, surface, and atmosphere. For example, Mars does not now have an active magnetic field, although strong remanent magnetization features exist in the ancient crust. These results imply that an internal dynamo ceased operation early in geologic time. Altimetry and gravity data indicate that the crust is thickest under the south pole, thinning northward from the cratered terrain to the northern plains. Analysis of altimetry data demonstrates that Mars is “egg-shaped” with gravitational equipotential contours that show that channel systems in the southern highlands drained to the north, largely to the Chryse trough. A closed contour in the northern plains is consistent with the existence of a great northern ocean. Emission spectra of low-albedo regions show that basaltic rocks dominate spectral signatures on the southern highlands, whereas basaltic andesites dominate the northern lowlands. The bright regions show nondiagnostic spectra, similar to that of dust in the atmosphere. Signatures of aqueous minerals (e.g., clays, carbonates, and sulfates) are noticeably absent from the emission spectra. High spatial resolution images show that the surface has been extensively modified by wind and that layering is nearly ubiquitous, implying that a complex history of events is recorded in surface and near-surface materials. Altimetry data imply that both permanent caps are composed of water ice and dust, with seasonal covers of carbon dioxide frost. Finally, the altimetry data, coupled with thousands of atmospheric profiles, are providing new boundary conditions and dynamic controls for the generation and testing of more realistic dynamic models of the global circulation of the atmosphere.},

	Abstract = {BEFORE the arrival of the Galileo spacecraft in the jovian system, there was little information on the interior structure of Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede. Its mean density (1,940 kg m−3), determined by the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft1--3, implies a composition that is roughly 60{\%} rock and 40{\%} ice, which could be uniformly mixed or differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle4. Here we report measurements by the Galileo spacecraft of Ganymede's overall density and the spherical harmonics, J2 and C22, of its gravitational field. These data show clearly that Ganymede has differentiated into a core and mantle. Combined with the recent discovery of an intrinsic magnetic field5,6, our gravity results suggest that Ganymede has a metallic core of radius 400--1,300 km surrounded by a silicate mantle, which is in turn enclosed by an ice shell ∼800 km thick. Depending on whether the core is pure iron or an alloy of iron and iron sulphide, it could account for as little as 1.4{\%} or as much as one-third of the total mass. If the ice were stripped away, Ganymede could look much like Io7 in terms of its size and internal mass distribution.},

 abstract = {Radio Doppler data from four encounters of the Galileo spacecraft with the jovian moon Europa have been used to refine models of Europa's interior. Europa is most likely differentiated into a metallic core surrounded by a rock mantle and a water ice-liquid outer shell, but the data cannot eliminate the possibility of a uniform mixture of dense silicate and metal beneath the water ice-liquid shell. The size of a metallic core is uncertain because of its unknown composition, but it could be as large as about 50 percent of Europa's radius. The thickness of Europa's outer shell of water ice-liquid must lie in the range of about 80 to 170 kilometers.},

abstract = {Radio Doppler data generated by the Deep Space Network (DSN) from four encounters of the Galileo spacecraft with Io, Jupiter's innermost Galilean satellite, are used to infer Io's gravitational quadrupole moments. By combining the four flybys into a single solution for the gravity field, the response of Io to the second degree tidal and rotational potentials is accurately determined. This is characterized by the value of the second degree potential Love number k2 = 1.2924 ± 0.0027. We construct interior models that satisfy constraints imposed by the mean radius R = 1821.6 ± 0.5 km, the mean density , and the normalized axial moment of inertia C/MR2 = 0.37685 ± 0.00035. The gravitationally derived figure of Io has principal axes (c < b < a) a = 1830.0 ± 0.5 km, b = 1819.2 ± 0.5 km, and c = 1815.6 ± 0.5 km, consistent with the shape determined by imaging. Gravitational and other data strongly suggest that Io is in hydrostatic equilibrium. In this case, models of Io's interior density show that Io almost certainly has a metallic core with a radius between 550 and 900 km for an Fe-FeS core or between 350 and 650 km for an Fe core. Io is also likely to have a crust and a partially molten asthenosphere, but their thicknesses cannot be separately or uniquely determined from the gravitational data.},

	Abstract = {Radio Doppler data generated by the Deep Space Network (DSN) from five encounters of the Galileo spacecraft with Callisto, Jupiter's outermost Galilean satellite, have been used to determine the mass (GM) and unnormalized quadrupole gravity coefficients in Callisto's external gravitational field. The results are GM=(7179.292$\pm$0.009) km3 s−2, J2=(32.7$\pm$0.8)×10−6, C22=(10.2$\pm$0.3)×10−6, S22=(−1.1$\pm$0.3)×10−6, C21=(0.0$\pm$0.3)×10−6, and S21=(0.0$\pm$1.6)×10−6. Also, four spacecraft images of Callisto have been used to determine its mean radius. The result is R=(2410.3$\pm$1.5) km, with no detectable deviation from sphericity. Derived parameters are Callisto's mean density of (1834.4$\pm$3.4) kg m−3 and axial moment of inertia C/MR2=0.3549$\pm$0.0042. While the mean density indicates that Callisto is a mixture of rock and ice, the moment of inertia is too small for a homogeneous mixture. Accordingly, we present a suite of possible two- and three-layer interior models that satisfy the given constraints for radius, density, and moment of inertia. While not unique, these models show that Callisto cannot be entirely differentiated, and that there must exist a region of mixed ice and rock--metal, possibly extending to the center of the satellite.},

        Abstract = {A global lunar topographic map with a spatial resolution of finer than 0.5 degree has been derived using data from the laser altimeter (LALT) on board the Japanese lunar explorer Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE or Kaguya). In comparison with the previous Unified Lunar Control Network (ULCN 2005) model, the new map reveals unbiased lunar topography for scales finer than a few hundred kilometers. Spherical harmonic analysis of global topographic data for the Moon, Earth, Mars, and Venus suggests that isostatic compensation is the prevailing lithospheric support mechanism at large scales. However, simple rigid support is suggested to dominate for the Moon, Venus, and Mars for smaller scales, which may indicate a drier lithosphere than on Earth, especially for the Moon and Venus.},

@article{Araki:2013,
	Abstract = {In this paper we review the lunar laser ranging conducted by the laser altimeter (LALT) on board the KAGUYA lunar explorer (2007--2009). Five aspects of LALT measurements are described: (1) General operational history, (2) Laser shot and data statistics, (3) Revisions to LALT topographic data, (4) Variations in laser output energy, and (5) Peak height analysis of laser echo pulses. LALT was able to range to the lunar surface despite some troubles with respect to laser output energy in the middle of the KAGUYA mission. The time series topographic data set was revised (Ver. 2) by incorporating new lunar gravity model based on KAGUYA and other historical lunar satellite's orbit data, along with other improvements, for example by incorporating the accurate position of the laser collimator on board the KAGUYA; however, more than half of the acquired range data could not be converted properly due to problems with orbit accuracy during the extended phase of the mission. The spherical harmonic coefficients and the basic lunar figure parameters derived from LALT_LGT_TS agree very well with LRO-LOLA and the Chang'E-1 LAM model. It is possible that partial failure to the laser diode was responsible for the gradual degradation of laser power (0.835mJ per million shots) and the rapid decrease that occurred over April 9--14, 2008. The laser power also proved to be extremely sensitive to the temperature of the laser oscillator. The peak height ratio -- that is peak height telemetry data divided by calculated ratio -- is about 19% on average using the mean slope and albedo data from LALT and Spectral Profiler on KAGUYA space craft, respectively, which suggests the performance of peak height measurement is more than 1/5 for more than 70km altitude, if compared with calculated one. The peak height ratio may be better if we take the effect of small scale topography within a footprint into account.},

abstract="This report continues the practice where the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements revises recommendations regarding those topics for the planets, satellites, minor planets, and comets approximately every 3years. The Working Group has now become a ``functional working group'' of the IAU, and its membership is open to anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results; Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1) Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) {\v{S}}teins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such information is valid only between specific epochs. The special challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko are also discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution. The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1) Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143) Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates. The Working Group also requests community input on the question submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate systems.",

abstract = "We present an improved lunar digital elevation model (DEM) covering latitudes within ±60°, at a horizontal resolution of 512pixels per degree (∼60m at the equator) and a typical vertical accuracy ∼3 to 4m. This DEM is constructed from ∼4.5×109 geodetically-accurate topographic heights from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, to which we co-registered 43,200 stereo-derived DEMs (each 1°×1°) from the SELENE Terrain Camera (TC) (∼1010pixels total). After co-registration, approximately 90% of the TC DEMs show root-mean-square vertical residuals with the LOLA data of <5m compared to ∼ 50% prior to co-registration. We use the co-registered TC data to estimate and correct orbital and pointing geolocation errors from the LOLA altimetric profiles (typically amounting to <10m horizontally and <1m vertically). By combining both co-registered datasets, we obtain a near-global DEM with high geodetic accuracy, and without the need for surface interpolation. We evaluate the resulting LOLA+TC merged DEM (designated as “SLDEM2015”) with particular attention to quantifying seams and crossover errors."

@article{Belton:1992,
	Abstract = {The Solid State Imaging (SSI) experiment on the Galileo Orbiter spacecraft utilizes a high-resolution (1500 mm focal length) television camera with an 800 {\texttimes} 800 pixel virtual-phase, charge-coupled detector. It is designed to return images of Jupiter and its satellites that are characterized by a combination of sensitivity levels, spatial resolution, geometric fiedelity, and spectral range unmatched by imaging data obtained previously. The spectral range extends from approximately 375 to 1100 nm and only in the near ultra-violet region (∼ 350 nm) is the spectral coverage reduced from previous missions. The camera is approximately 100 times more sensitive than those used in the Voyager mission, and, because of the nature of the satellite encounters, will produce images with approximately 100 times the ground resolution (i.e., ∼ 50 m lp-1) on the Galilean satellites. We describe aspects of the detector including its sensitivity to energetic particle radiation and how the requirements for a large full-well capacity and long-term stability in operating voltages led to the choice of the virtual phase chip. The F/8.5 camera system can reach point sources of V(mag) ∼ 11 with S/N ∼ 10 and extended sources with surface brightness as low as 20 kR in its highest gain state and longest exposure mode. We describe the performance of the system as determined by ground calibration and the improvements that have been made to the telescope (same basic catadioptric design that was used in Mariner 10 and the Voyager high-resolution cameras) to reduce the scattered light reaching the detector. The images are linearly digitized 8-bits deep and, after flat-fielding, are cosmetically clean. Information `preserving' and `non-preserving' on-board data compression capabilities are outlined. A special ``summation'' mode, designed for use deep in the Jovian radiation belts, near Io, is also described. The detector is `preflashed' before each exposure to ensure the photometric linearity. The dynamic range is spread over 3 gain states and an exposure range from 4.17 ms to 51.2 s. A low-level of radial, third-order, geometric distortion has been measured in the raw images that is entirely due to the optical design. The distortion is of the pincushion type and amounts to about 1.2 pixels in the corners of the images. It is expected to be very stable.},

Using PolyCam panchromatic images, we constructed a globally controlled basemap of Bennu at an approximate ground sample distance of 5 cm with a mean spatial accuracy of ~30 cm. The basemap was photometrically normalized using a Minneart phase angle correction. New mapping methods were developed to combine images of Bennu's irregular shape and extremely rough surface into a nearly seamless mosaic. Here we present the global basemap of Bennu and discuss the image processing techniques used to construct a high-resolution mosaic of an irregular small body.},

abstract = {Abstract NASA's Cassini spacecraft spent 13 years exploring the Saturn system, including 23 targeted flybys of the small, geologically active moon Enceladus. These flybys provided a wealth of image data from Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem. To improve the usability of the Enceladus data set, we created a new, global photogrammetric control network for Enceladus that enabled compilation of a versatile cartographic package to support geologic mapping and other investigations. The network used 586 images in four image filters with a pixel scale generally between 50 and 500 m per pixel and a phase angle less than 120° and consisted of 10,362 tie points and 173,704 individual image measures, averaging nearly 17 measures per tie point. Least squares bundle adjustment resulted in a root-mean-square residual of 0.45 pixel, corresponding to root-mean-square ground point uncertainties of 66, 51, and 46 m in latitude, longitude, and radius, respectively. Using our geodetic control network, we created new global image mosaics, coregistered flyby mosaics to support geologic mapping, and updated pointing kernels for every image used in the solution. These products, including the updated pointing kernels, are available to the community through NASA's Planetary Data System Imaging Annex. The bundle adjustment solution also yielded independently determined shape information, resulting in radii within the stated uncertainty of International Astronomical Union values. The challenges of the data set, and the technical methodology described here are applicable to bodies imaged during multiple flybys with variable viewing and illumination geometry, including other midsized satellites of Saturn, and the Europa Clipper mission.},

abstract = {Abstract With the conclusion of the Cassini mission, we present an updated topographic map of Titan, including all the available altimetry, SARtopo, and stereophotogrammetry topographic data sets available from the mission. We use radial basis functions to interpolate the sparse data set, which covers only ∼9\% of Titan's global area. The most notable updates to the topography include higher coverage of the poles of Titan, improved fits to the global shape, and a finer resolution of the global interpolation. We also present a statistical analysis of the error in the derived products and perform a global minimization on a profile-by-profile basis to account for observed biases in the input data set. We find a greater flattening of Titan than measured, additional topographic rises in Titan's southern hemisphere and better constrain the possible locations of past and present liquids on Titan's surface.},

abstract = {Abstract The OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission is the third mission in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s New Frontiers Program and is the first U.S. mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth. The most important decision ahead of the OSIRIS-REx team is the selection of a prime sample-site on the surface of asteroid (101955) Bennu. Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.},

@article{Domingue:2016icarus,
	Abstract = {Photometric analyses are used to standardize images obtained at a variety of illumination and viewing conditions to a common geometry for the construction of maps or mosaics and for comparison with spectral measurements acquired in the laboratory. Many models exist that can be used to model photometric behavior. Two of the most commonly use models, those of Hapke and Kaasalainen--Shkuratov, are compared for their ability to standardize MESSENGER images of Mercury. Analysis of the modeling results shows that photometric corrections using the Kaasalainen--Shkuratov model provides significantly less contrast between images acquired at large differences in emission angle. The contrast seen between images acquired at large differences in either incidence and phase angle is smaller with the Hapke model based corrections, but not significantly better than that provided by the Kaasalainen--Shkuratov model. Photometric studies are also used to infer scattering properties of the surface regolith. The quantitative correlation between photometric model parameters and surface properties is questionable, but laboratory studies do indicate general correlations and trends between parameters and sample properties that allow for comparisons between surfaces based on photometric modeling. Based on comparisons with the Moon and several asteroids that have been observed by spacecraft, the photometric analyses presented here are interpreted to indicate that Mercury's regolith is smoother on micrometer scales and has a narrower particle size distribution with a lower mean particle size than lunar regolith. Grain structures of regolith particles from Mercury are inferred to be different than those of the Moon or those asteroids observed to date. Mercury's regolith may contain a component compositionally distinct from lunar regolith.},

	Abstract = {Unambiguous reference systems are a fundamental requirement for accurate and reliable geodetic products. The definition of the reference system, the realization by a reference frame, and the allocation of the geodetic datum have to be strictly coherent. In traditional geodetic reference systems used in triangulation and trilateration networks, the datum was given through independent (astronomic) observations in selected fundamental stations, which fixed the origin and the orientation of the coordinate system. The datum of modern geocentric reference systems must also be determined by independent methods, namely by gravity field parameters and physical models. If it is derived from the reference frame itself, i.e., by coordinate transformations between selected reference stations, the definition of the system will be changed: It does no longer refer to the geo-centre but to the centre of the reference network. Therefore it is indispensable to strictly pay attention that the datum is not affected by the measurements of the frame, and that the realization of the frame does not change the definition of the system},

	Abstract = {In this study, 96 digital terrain models (DTMs) of Mercury were created using the Ames Stereo Pipeline, using 1456 pairs of stereo images from the Mercury Dual Imaging System instrument on MESSENGER. Although these DTMs cover only ~1% of the surface of Mercury, they enable three-dimensional characterization of landforms at horizontal resolutions of ~50--250m/pixel and vertical accuracy of tens of meters. This is valuable in regions where the more precise measurements from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) are sparse. MLA measurements nonetheless provide an important geodetic framework for the derived stereo products. These DTMs, which are publicly released in conjunction with this paper, reveal topography of features at relatively small scales, including craters, graben, hollows, pits, scarps, and wrinkle ridges. Measurements from these data indicate that: (1) hollows have a median depth of ~32m, in basic agreement with earlier shadow measurement, (2) some of the deep pits (up to ~4km deep) that are interpreted to form via volcanic processes on Mercury have surrounding rims or rises, but others do not, and (3) some pits have two or more distinct, low-lying interior minima that could represent multiple vents.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate the topography of the surface within the InSight candidate landing ellipses, we generated Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) at lander scales and those appropriate for entry, descent, and landing simulations, along with orthoimages of both images in each stereopair, and adirectional slope images. These products were used to assess the distribution of slopes for each candidate ellipse and terrain type in the landing site region, paying particular attention to how these slopes impact InSight landing and engineering safety, and results are reported here. Overall, this region has extremely low slopes at 1-meter baseline scales and meets the safety constraints of the InSight lander. The majority of the landing ellipse has a mean slope at 1-meter baselines of 3.2{\textdegree}. In addition, a mosaic of HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE DTMs within the final landing ellipse (ellipse 9) was generated to support entry, descent, and landing simulations and evaluations. Several methods were tested to generate this mosaic and the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline program dem{\_}mosaic produced the best results. For the HRSC-CTX-HiRISE DTM mosaic, more than 99 {\%} of the mosaic has slopes less than 15{\textdegree}, and the introduction of artificially high slopes along image seams was minimized.},

	Abstract = {Both the Chang'E-1 and SELenological and ENgineering Explorer (SELENE) lunar missions, launched in 2007, provide an opportunity for significant advances in lunar science. In particular, both orbiters provide refined lunar topography models with unprecedented finer resolution and improved accuracy, especially for the far side and the polar areas of the Moon where fewer valid measurements have been available to date. An evaluation of the derived topography models is essential for the improved interpretation of selenophysics, including a knowledge of the interior of the Moon. This study provides both external and internal accuracy assessments for the derived topographic models (note that different data sets are used, albeit independent). The external comparison, which consists of comparing the topographic models with landmarks established with lunar laser ranging and radio tracking, yields an accuracy estimate of 157 m for the Change'E-1 model and 58 m for the SELENE model (150 m and 55 m if the newly recovered Lunakhod-1 site is included). The internal comparison, consisting of crossover analysis of the altimeter data after the removal of once-per-orbital-revolution errors, yields an accuracy estimate of 206 m and 68 m, respectively. These comparisons allow the establishment of conservative estimates of accuracy of 200 m and 70 m for the Chang'E-1 and SELENE models, respectively. Given the conservative estimates on the accuracy, both models yield significant improvement by factors of 2.5 and 8, respectively, when compared with a contemporary lunar topography model, i.e., the Unified Lunar Control Network 2005 (ULCN2005).},

abstract = {During the first 8 months of the Magellan mission, the radar altimeter has made some three million measurements of the surface of Venus covering the latitude range from 85°N to 80°S. Methods involving range correlation, Doppler filtering, multi-burst summation, and range migration are used to focus the observations and to achieve high surface resolution. Results are presented as maps of the global distribution of topography, meter-scale roughness, and power reflection coefficient. The results are similar to those reported in previous experiments (surface heights exhibit a unimodal distribution with more than 80\% of the surface lying within 1 km of the 6051.84-km mean radius) but the higher resolution of the Magellan altimeter has disclosed several surprisingly steep features, e.g. the southwest face of the Maxwell Montes, the southern face of the Danu Montes, and the chasmata to the east of Thetis Regio, where average kilometer-scale slopes of greater than 30° are not uncommon. This conclusion is corroborated by close inspection of synthetic aperture radar imagery.},

	Abstract = {We present a spherical harmonic solution of the static gravity field of Mars to degree and order 120, GMM-3, that has been calculated using the Deep Space Network tracking data of the NASA Mars missions, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Odyssey (ODY), and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). We have also jointly determined spherical harmonic solutions for the static and time-variable gravity field of Mars, and the Mars k2 Love numbers, exclusive of the gravity contribution of the atmosphere. Consequently, the retrieved time-varying gravity coefficients and the Love number k2 solely yield seasonal variations in the mass of the polar caps and the solid tides of Mars, respectively. We obtain a Mars Love number k2 of 0.1697 $\pm$ 0.0027 (3-σ). The inclusion of MRO tracking data results in improved seasonal gravity field coefficients C30 and, for the first time, C50. Refinements of the atmospheric model in our orbit determination program have allowed us to monitor the odd zonal harmonic C30 for ∼1.5 solar cycles (16 years). This gravity model shows improved correlations with MOLA topography up to 15% larger at higher harmonics (l = 60--80) than previous solutions.},

abstract = {Abstract Geodetic analysis of radio tracking measurements of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft while in orbit about Mercury has yielded new estimates for the planet's gravity field, tidal Love number, and pole coordinates. The derived right ascension (α = 281.0082° ± 0.0009°; all uncertainties are 3 standard deviations) and declination (δ = 61.4164° ± 0.0003°) of the spin pole place Mercury in the Cassini state. Confirmation of the equilibrium state with an estimated mean (whole planet) obliquity ϵ of 1.968 ± 0.027 arcmin enables the confident determination of the planet's normalized polar moment of inertia (0.333 ± 0.005), which indicates a high degree of internal differentiation. Internal structure models generated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo process and consistent with the geodetic constraints possess a solid inner core with a radius (ric) between 0.3 and 0.7 that of the outer core (roc).},

abstract = {An approximate analytic solution to the radiative transfer equation describing the scattering of light from particulate surfaces is derived. Multiple scattering and mutual shadowing are taken into account. Analytic expressions for the following quantities are found: bidirectional reflectance, radiance factor, radiance coefficient, normal, hemispherical, Bond, and physical albedos, integral phase function, phase integral, and limb-darkening profile. Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as corrections for comparing experimental laboratory transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra. An expression for the scattering efficiency of an irregular particle large compared with the wavelength is derived. For closely spaced, nonopaque particles this efficiency is approximated by (1 + αDe)−l, where α is the true absorption coefficient and De is an effective particle diameter of the order of twice the mean particle size. For monomineralic surfaces it is shown that α = ( 1 − w)/wDe, where w is the single-scattering albedo and can be determined from reflectance measurements of a powder, so that α may be calculated from reflectance. This theory should be useful for interpretations of reflectance spectroscopy of laboratory surfaces and photometry of solar system objects. From photometric observations of a body the following may be estimated: average single-scattering albedo, average particle phase function, average macroscopic slope, and porosity.},

	Abstract = {For more than a decade there has been a push in the planetary science community to support interoperable methods for accessing and working with geospatial data. Common geospatial data products for planetary research include image mosaics, digital elevation or terrain models, geologic maps, geographic location databases (e.g., craters, volcanoes) or any data that can be tied to the surface of a planetary body (including moons, comets or asteroids). Several U.S. and international cartographic research institutions have converged on mapping standards that embrace standardized geospatial image formats, geologic mapping conventions, U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) cartographic and metadata standards, and notably on-line mapping services as defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The latter includes defined standards such as the OGC Web Mapping Services (simple image maps), Web Map Tile Services (cached image tiles), Web Feature Services (feature streaming), Web Coverage Services (rich scientific data streaming), and Catalog Services for the Web (data searching and discoverability). While these standards were developed for application to Earth-based data, they can be just as valuable for planetary domain. Another initiative, called VESPA (Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access), will marry several of the above geoscience standards and astronomy-based standards as defined by International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). This work outlines the current state of interoperability initiatives in use or in the process of being researched within the planetary geospatial community.},

@article{HENRIKSEN:2017icarus,
        Abstract = {The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) includes two identical Narrow Angle Cameras (NAC) that each provide 0.5 to 2.0m scale images of the lunar surface. Although not designed as a stereo system, LROC can acquire NAC stereo observations over two or more orbits using at least one off-nadir slew. Digital terrain models (DTMs) are generated from sets of stereo images and registered to profiles from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) to improve absolute accuracy. With current processing methods, DTMs have absolute accuracies better than the uncertainties of the LOLA profiles and relative vertical and horizontal precisions less than the pixel scale of the DTMs (2--5m). We computed slope statistics from 81 highland and 31 mare DTMs across a range of baselines. For a baseline of 15m the highland mean slope parameters are: median=9.1$\,^{\circ}$, mean=11.0$\,^{\circ}$, standard deviation=7.0$\,^{\circ}$. For the mare the mean slope parameters are: median=3.5$\,^{\circ}$, mean=4.9$\,^{\circ}$, standard deviation=4.5$\,^{\circ}$. The slope values for the highland terrain are steeper than previously reported, likely due to a bias in targeting of the NAC DTMs toward higher relief features in the highland terrain. Overlapping DTMs of single stereo sets were also combined to form larger area DTM mosaics that enable detailed characterization of large geomorphic features. From one DTM mosaic we mapped a large viscous flow related to the Orientale basin ejecta and estimated its thickness and volume to exceed 300m and 500km3, respectively. Despite its ∼3.8 billion year age the flow still exhibits unconfined margin slopes above 30$\,^{\circ}$, in some cases exceeding the angle of repose, consistent with deposition of material rich in impact melt. We show that the NAC stereo pairs and derived DTMs represent an invaluable tool for science and exploration purposes. At this date about 2% of the lunar surface is imaged in high-resolution stereo, and continued acquisition of stereo observations will serve to strengthen our knowledge of the Moon and geologic processes that occur across all of the terrestrial planets.},

	Abstract = {Of all the solar system bodies, Venus is the most like Earth in terms of average surface age, size, distance from the Sun, and diversity of volcanic and deformational features. Despite these similarities, Venus does not currently have plate tectonics and is uninhabitable, and it is not known whether these two conditions are related. As technology advances and such missions as NASA's Kepler begin to detect Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone around other stars, understanding the evolution of Venus will be critical in assessing the odds that ``Earth-sized'' equates to ``Earth-like.'' Unfortunately, there has not been a geology-oriented spacecraft mission to Venus since the Magellan mission (1989--1994), and no missions are currently planned.},

	Abstract = {Saturn{\textquoteright}s moon Enceladus has often been the focus of flybys of the Cassini spacecraft. Although small{\textemdash}Enceladus is roughly 10 times smaller than Saturn{\textquoteright}s largest moon, Titan{\textemdash}Enceladus has shown hints of having a complex internal structure rich in liquid water. Iess et al. (p. 78) used long-range data collected by the Cassini spacecraft to construct a gravity model of Enceladus. The resulting gravity field indicates the presence of a large mass anomaly at its south pole. Calculations of the moment of inertia and hydrostatic equilibrium from the gravity data suggest the presence of a large, regional subsurface ocean 30 to 40 km deep. The small and active Saturnian moon Enceladus is one of the primary targets of the Cassini mission. We determined the quadrupole gravity field of Enceladus and its hemispherical asymmetry using Doppler data from three spacecraft flybys. Our results indicate the presence of a negative mass anomaly in the south-polar region, largely compensated by a positive subsurface anomaly compatible with the presence of a regional subsurface sea at depths of 30 to 40 kilometers and extending up to south latitudes of about 50{\textdegree}. The estimated values for the largest quadrupole harmonic coefficients (106J2 = 5435.2 {\textpm} 34.9, 106C22 = 1549.8 {\textpm} 15.6, 1σ) and their ratio (J2/C22 = 3.51 {\textpm} 0.05) indicate that the body deviates mildly from hydrostatic equilibrium. The moment of inertia is around 0.335MR2, where M is the mass and R is the radius, suggesting a differentiated body with a low-density core.},

abstract = "The Rosetta spacecraft flew by Asteroid (2867) Steins on 5 September 2008, allowing the onboard OSIRIS cameras to collect the first images of an E-type asteroid. We implemented several three-dimensional reconstruction techniques to retrieve its shape. Limb profiles, combined with stereo control points, were used to reconstruct an approximate shape model. This model was refined using a stereophotoclinometry technique to accurately retrieve the topography of the hemisphere observed by OSIRIS. The unseen part of the surface was constrained by the technique of light curves inversion. The global shape resembles a top with dimensions along the principal axes of inertia of 6.83×5.70×4.42km. It is conspicuously more regular than other small asteroids like (233) Eros and (25143) Itokawa. Its mean radius is Rm=2.70km and its equivalent radius (radius of a sphere of equivalent volume) is Rv=2.63km. The north pole is oriented at RA=99±5° and Dec=−59±5°, which implies a very large obliquity of 172° and a retrograde rotation. Maps of the gravitational field and slopes were calculated for the well-imaged part of the asteroid. Together with the shape, they helped characterizing the most prominent topographic features identified at the surface of (2867) Steins: an equatorial ridge restricted to the extremities of the long axis, a large crater having dimensions of 2100×1800m in the southern hemisphere, and an elongated hill in the northern hemisphere. We conjecture that the equatorial ridge was formed by centrifugal acceleration as the asteroid was spun up by the Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect."

abstract = {The objectives of this paper are twofold: first, to report our estimates of the meter-to-decameter-scale topography and slopes of candidate landing sites for the Phoenix mission, based on analysis of Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images with a typical pixel scale of 3 m and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images at 0.3 m pixel−1 and, second, to document in detail the geometric calibration, software, and procedures on which the photogrammetric analysis of HiRISE data is based. A combination of optical design modeling, laboratory observations, star images, and Mars images form the basis for software in the U.S. Geological Survey Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) 3 system that corrects the images for a variety of distortions with single-pixel or subpixel accuracy. Corrected images are analyzed in the commercial photogrammetric software SOCET SET (® BAE Systems), yielding digital topographic models (DTMs) with a grid spacing of 1 m (3–4 pixels) that require minimal interactive editing. Photoclinometry yields DTMs with single-pixel grid spacing. Slopes from MOC and HiRISE are comparable throughout the latitude zone of interest and compare favorably with those where past missions have landed successfully; only the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) B site in Meridiani Planum is smoother. MOC results at multiple locations have root-mean-square (RMS) bidirectional slopes of 0.8–4.5° at baselines of 3–10 m. HiRISE stereopairs (one per final candidate site and one in the former site) yield 1.8–2.8° slopes at 1-m baseline. Slopes at 1 m from photoclinometry are also in the range 2–3° after correction for image blur. Slopes exceeding the 16° Phoenix safety limit are extremely rare.},

abstract = "With the collection of six years of MGS tracking data and three years of Mars Odyssey tracking data, there has been a continual improvement in the JPL Mars gravity field determination. This includes the measurement of the seasonal changes in the gravity coefficients (e.g., J¯2, J¯3, C¯21, S¯21, C¯31, S¯31) caused by the mass exchange between the polar ice caps and atmosphere. This paper describes the latest gravity field MGS95J to degree and order 95. The improvement comes from additional tracking data and the adoption of a more complete Mars orientation model with nutation, instead of the IAU 2000 model. Free wobble of the Mars' spin axis, i.e. polar motion, has been constrained to be less than 10 mas by looking at the temporal history of C¯21 and S¯21. A strong annual signature is observed in C¯21, and this is a mixture of polar motion and ice mass redistribution. The Love number solution with a subset of Odyssey tracking data is consistent with the previous liquid outer core determination from MGS tracking data [Yoder et al., 2003. Science 300, 299–303], giving a combined solution of k2=0.152±0.009 using MGS and Odyssey tracking data. The solutions for the masses of the Mars' moons show consistency between MGS, Odyssey, and Viking data sets; Phobos GM=(7.16±0.005)×10−4 km3/s2 and Deimos GM=(0.98±0.07)×10−4 km3/s2. Average MGS orbit errors, determined from differences in the overlaps of orbit solutions, have been reduced to 10-cm in the radial direction and 1.5 m along the spacecraft velocity and normal to the orbit plane. Hence, the ranging to the MGS and Odyssey spacecraft has resulted in position measurements of the Mars system center-of-mass relative to the Earth to an accuracy of one meter, greatly reducing the Mars ephemeris errors by several orders of magnitude, and providing mass estimates for Asteroids 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta, and 324 Bamberga."

	Abstract = {With 2years of tracking data collection from the MRO spacecraft, there is noticeable improvement in the high frequency portion of the spherical harmonic Mars gravity field. The new JPL Mars gravity fields, MRO110B and MRO110B2, show resolution near degree 90. Additional years of MGS and Mars Odyssey tracking data result in improvement for the seasonal J¯3 gravity changes which compares well to global circulation models and Odyssey neutron data and Mars rotation and precession (ψ˙=-7594$\pm$10mas/year). Once atmospheric dust is accounted for in the spacecraft solar pressure model, solutions for Mars solar tide are consistent between data sets and show slightly larger values (k2=0.164$\pm$0.009, after correction for atmospheric tide) compared to previous results, further constraining core models. An additional 4years of Mars range data improves the Mars ephemeris, determines 21 asteroid masses and bounds solar mass loss (dGMSun/dt<1.6×10−13GMSunyear−1).},

        Abstract = {The objective of the Dawn gravity investigation is to use high precision X-band Doppler tracking and landmark tracking from optical images to measure the gravity fields of Vesta and Ceres to a half-wavelength surface resolution better than 90-km and 300-km, respectively. Depending on the Doppler tracking assumptions, the gravity field will be determined to somewhere between harmonic degrees 15 and 25 for Vesta and about degree 10 for Ceres. The gravity fields together with shape models determined from Dawn's framing camera constrain models of the interior from the core to the crust. The gravity field is determined jointly with the spin pole location. The second degree harmonics together with assumptions on obliquity or hydrostatic equilibrium may determine the moments of inertia.},

The gravity field, orientation parameters, landmark locations, and Vesta’s orbit are jointly estimated. The resulting spherical harmonic gravity field has a half-wavelength resolution of 42km (degree 20). The gravitational mass uncertainty is nearly 1 part in 106. The inertial spin pole location is determined to better than 0.0001° and the uncertainty in the rotation period has been reduced by nearly a factor of 100. The combined precession and nutation of the pole of Vesta has been detected with angular rates about 70\% of expected values, but not well enough to constrain the moment of inertia. The optical landmark position estimates reduce the uncertainty in the center-of-mass and center-of-figure offset to 10m. The Vesta ephemeris uncertainty during the Dawn stay was reduced from 20km to better than 10m in the Earth–Vesta direction."

The implementation framework is drawn from terrestrially developed theoretical models (e.g., product-based, process-based, and complex adaptive system approaches) and case studies from large-scale, multiorganization, or transnational spatial data infrastructures. We adapt these terrestrially proven techniques for the planetary sciences and present a Europa case study. This case study includes a knowledge inventory of available foundational and framework data products, the availability and access mechanisms currently used to discover said products, the interoperability of said products in geographic information systems, a review of the policies and standards currently being used by the Europa science community, and discussion of the users a Europa PSDI would serve.

The other two New Frontiers missions are New Horizons, which explored Pluto during a flyby in July 2015 and is on its way for a flyby of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019, and Juno, an orbiting mission that is studying the origin, evolution, and internal structure of Jupiter. The spacecraft departed for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu aboard an United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 evolved expendable launch vehicle at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016, on a seven-year journey to return samples from Bennu. The spacecraft is on an outbound-cruise trajectory that will result in a rendezvous with Bennu in November 2018. The science instruments on the spacecraft will survey Bennu to measure its physical, geological, and chemical properties, and the team will use these data to select a site on the surface to collect at least 60 g of asteroid regolith. The team will also analyze the remote-sensing data to perform a detailed study of the sample site for context, assess Bennu's resource potential, refine estimates of its impact probability with Earth, and provide ground-truth data for the extensive astronomical data set collected on this asteroid. The spacecraft will leave Bennu in 2021 and return the sample to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 24, 2023.},

During the mapping mission, MGS was located in a near-polar (92.9° inclination) and near-circular orbit at a mean altitude of 400 km. The tracking data from this orbit provide a detailed, global, and high resolution view of the gravity field of Mars. Mars gravity solutions are stable to 60×60 even without application of a Kaula power law constraint. The Valles Marineris is resolved distinctly with lows reaching −450 mGals. Olympus Mons and its aureole are both separately resolved, and the volcano has a peak anomaly of 2950 mGals. The global correlation of the GMM-2B gravity coefficients with MOLA-derived topography is 0.78 through degree 60, and the correlation remains above 0.6 through degree 62. The global gravity anomaly error predicted from the GMM-2B error covariance through 60×60 is 11 mGal. The global geoid error from GMM-2B through 60×60 is 1.8 m. MGS orbit quality using GMM-2B, as measured by overlapping orbital arcs, is 1 m in the radial direction and 10 m in total position.},

The lowest point observed (∼1700m below a 2575km sphere) is at 59°S, 317°W: this may be a basin where liquids presently in the north could have resided in the past. If the deepest point were once a sea with the areal extent of present-day Ligeia Mare, it would be ∼1000m deep.

Our objectives are principally pedagogic, in order to relate the development of geoportals to SDI initiatives and to review recent technological breakthroughs----specifically the development of direct access facilities for application services and metadata records, and the facility to utilize services directly from conventional desktop GIS applications. We also discuss the contributions that geoportals and SDI have made to simplifying access to GI, and their contribution to diffusing GI concepts, databases, techniques and models. Finally, the role of geoportals in electronic government (e-Government) is considered.},

abstract = "We have analyzed the complete Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data archive of Titan. Our objective is to build global surface cartographic products, by combining all the data gathered during the 127 targeted flybys of Titan into synthetic global maps interpolated on a grid at 32 pixels per degree (∼1.4 km/pixel at the equator), in seven infrared spectral atmospheric windows. Multispectral summary images have been computed for each single VIMS cube in order to rapidly identify their scientific content and assess their quality. These summary images are made available to the community on a public website (vims.univ-nantes.fr). The global mapping work faced several challenges due to the strong absorbing and scattering effects of the atmosphere coupled to the changing observing conditions linked to the orbital tour of the Cassini mission. We determined a surface photometric function which accounts for variations in incidence, emergence and phase angles, and which is able to mitigate brightness variations linked to the viewing geometry of the flybys. The atmospheric contribution has been reduced using the subtraction of the methane absorption band wings, considered as proxies for atmospheric haze scattering. We present a new global three color composite map of band ratios (red: 1.59/1.27 µm; green: 2.03/1.27 µm; blue: 1.27/1.08 µm), which has also been empirically corrected from an airmass (the solar photon path length through the atmosphere) dependence. This map provides a detailed global color view of Titan's surface partially corrected from the atmosphere and gives a global insight of the spectral variability, with the equatorial dunes fields appearing in brownish tones, and several occurrences of bluish tones localized in areas such as Sinlap, Menvra and Selk craters. This kind of spectral map can serve as a basis for further regional studies and comparisons with radiative transfer outputs, such as surface albedos, and other additional data sets acquired by the Cassini Radar (RADAR) and Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) instruments."

	Abstract = {The international Cassini/Huygens mission consists of the Cassini Saturn Orbiter spacecraft and the Huygens Titan Probe that is targeted for entry into the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. From launch on October 15, 1997 to arrival at Saturn in July 2004, Cassini/Huygens will travel over three billion kilometers. Once in orbit about Saturn, Huygens is released from the orbiter and enters Titan's atmosphere. The Probe descends by parachute and measures the properties of the atmosphere. If the landing is gentle, the properties of the surface will be measured too. Then the orbiter commences a four-year tour of the Saturnian system with 45 flybys of Titan and multiple encounters with the icy moons. The rings, the magnetosphere and Saturn itself are all studied as well as the interactions among them.},

abstract = {In its first 15 months of continuous operation, the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument aboard Mars Global Surveyor ranged to Mars over 330 million times, generating more than 5000 orbital profiles, with a ranging precision of 0.4 m over smooth terrain. The accuracy of the profiles depends on knowledge of the spacecraft position, orientation, and observation time, which are subject to errors. We model these errors via the analysis of over 24 million altimetric crossovers. A quasiperiodic, once per revolution adjustment of the ground tracks as a function of time in three locally orthogonal directions minimizes the altimetric residuals via least-squares. Using a sparse matrix technique, computational effort scales linearly with the number of crossovers and only marginally with the number of parameters. Orbital errors mainly result from poor modeling of spacecraft thrusting events in the absence of tracking. Seasonal effects, likely due to changing thermal environment, as well as residual miscalibrations, are evident in the pointing solutions. Incorporating multiple parameters per revolution significantly improves crossover residuals, and resolves pointing aberrations during orbital transitions from night to day. Altimetry from the adjusted tracks generates a topographic model whose accuracy is typically better than 1 m vertically with respect to the center of mass of Mars. The centroid position of each MOLA shot is typically accurate to ∼100 m horizontally. Terrain models from accurately located lidar data can be gradient-shaded to illuminate geological structures with 1 in 1000 slopes that are invisible to cameras. Temporal changes in elevation (e.g., frost deposition/ablation) at decimeter levels may also be assessed using crossovers, but results must be interpreted with caution due to uncertainties in range walk correction.},

The elongated nucleus has an overall concave shape, resembling a peanut, with the lower end tilted towards the camera. The bimodal character of surface-slopes and curvatures support the idea that the nucleus is a gravitational aggregate, consisting of two fragments in contact. Our photometric modeling suggests that topographic shading effects on Borrelly's surface are very minor (<10%) at the given resolution of the terrain model. Instead, albedo effects are thought to dominate Borrelly's large variations in surface brightness. With 90% of the visible surface having single scattering albedos between 0.008 and 0.024, Borrelly is confirmed to be among the darkest of the known Solar System objects. Photometrically corrected images emphasize that the nucleus has distinct, contiguous terrains covered with either bright or dark, smooth or mottled materials. Also, mapping of the changes in surface brightness with phase angle suggests that terrain roughness at subpixel scale is not uniform over the nucleus. High surface roughness is noted in particular near the transition between the upper and lower end of the nucleus, as well as near the presumed source region of Borrelly's main jets. Borrelly's surface is complex and characterized by distinct types of materials that have different compositional and/or physical properties."

	Abstract = {A new global control point network was derived for Phobos, based on SRC (Mars Express), Phobos-2, and Viking Orbiter image data. We derive 3-D Cartesian coordinates for 813 control points as well as improved pointing data for 202 SRC and Viking images in the Phobos-fixed coordinate system. The point accuracies vary from 4.5m on the Phobos nearside, to up to 67.0m on the farside, where we rely on Viking images (average point accuracy: 13.7m). From tracking of the control points we detect a librational motion synchronous to the Phobos orbital period and measure libration amplitude of 1.09$\,^{\circ}$, in agreement with predictions from shape information assuming a uniform interior. This suggests that the interior of Phobos is homogeneous -- but small local mass anomalies, e.g., associated with crater Stickney, cannot be ruled out. Our new control point network has a higher number of data points and higher point accuracy than previous data products and will be an important basis for accurate shape models and maps.},

        Abstract = {We present a high-resolution global shape model of Ceres determined using the stereophotoclinometry technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by processing Dawn's Framing Camera data acquired during Approach to post-Low Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) phases of the mission. A total of about 38,000 images were processed with pixel resolutions ranging from 35.6 km/pixel to 35 m/pixel and the final global shape model was produced with 100-m grid spacing. The final SPC-derived topography was computed relative to the (482 km, 482 km, 446 km) mean ellipsoid, which ranges from −7.3 km to 9.5 km. For the purpose of validation, we performed various error analyses to assess and quantify realistic uncertainties in the derived topography, such as dividing the data into different subsets and re-computing the entire topography. Based on these studies, we show that the average total height error of the final global topography model is 10.2 m and 88.9\% of the surface has the total height error below 20 m. We also provide improved estimates of several physical parameters of Ceres. The resulting GM estimate is (62.62905 $\pm$ 0.00035) km3/s2, or the mass value of (938.392 $\pm$ 0.005) × 1018 kg. The volume estimate is (434.13 $\pm$ 0.50) × 106 km3 with a volumetric mean radius of 469.72 km. Combined with the mass estimate, the resulting bulk density is (2161.6 $\pm$ 2.5) kg/m3. Other improved parameters include the pole right ascension, α0 = (291.42763 $\pm$ 0.0002)$\,^{\circ}$, pole declination, δ0 = (66.76033 $\pm$ 0.0002)$\,^{\circ}$, and prime meridian and rotation rate of (W0 = 170.309 $\pm$ 0.011)$\,^{\circ}$ and (dW/dt = 952.1532635 $\pm$ 0.000002) deg/day, respectively.

A modified version (Kim and Muller, 2009) of a NASA-VICAR-based pipeline developed by DLR (German Aerospace Centre) and JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) has been employed with image matching based on the Gotcha (Gruen-Otto-Chau) algorithm (Shin and Muller, 2012) with a specialised setup for the polar region. DTM products have been produced with more than twice the resolution (50 m/pixel) of the gridded Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) 512 pixels/degree (112 m/pixel) over the South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC) and the Mars South Polar region (82° - 90° S) in MOLA and areoid reference. The accuracy of the HRSC orbital DTMs are compared against a MOLA reference with good results. HRSC orthorectified strip images from 12.5 to 50 m have also been produced from the base DTMs and these have been processed into a 12.5 m mosaic. HRSC strip products are currently being assessed as base images for automatic co-registration of thousands of high-resolution images, making them geometrically consistent with the surface conditions imaged by HRSC. In some cases, Context Camera (CTX) DTMs have been automatically produced and co-registered to the HRSC image strips and these, in turn, are being employed for automated co-registration of higher-resolution images."

abstract="The Dawn mission journeys to the center of the main asteroid belt to orbit and explore the two most massive main belt asteroids, Vesta and Ceres. Dawn aims to increase our understanding not just of the present state of these two bodies, but also of the conditions during the time of their formation. It attempts this through achieving a set of measurement objectives in which the physical properties of these asteroids such as mass, slopes, size, density, and spin state are accurately determined, and in which the mineralogical and elemental composition of the surface and near-surface material are probed. Dawn employs ion propulsion technology to enable a modestly-sized launcher to start a moderately-sized spacecraft on its journey, to not only reach the two massive asteroids but also to orbit them, descending to near the surface. Unlike most orbital missions, the initial (Vesta) phase must be completed with sufficient reserves and within a time window that later allows Dawn to explore Ceres. Dawn carries a redundant framing camera, a visible and near-IR spectrometer, a gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, and achieves high-accuracy radiometric and optical navigation to enable gravity field determination. The spacecraft was developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation under the management of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Dawn is a Principal Investigator-led mission of the Discovery Program. The PI institution, the University of California, Los Angeles, manages directly the science team, the Dawn Science Center, and the Education and Public Outreach program.",

abstract = {The NASA Magellan Venus Radar Mapper spacecraft was launched into an interplanetary transfer trajectory to Venus on May 4, 1989, and will be placed into orbit around Venus on August 10, 1990. The orbiter carries a 12-cm-wavelength, multimode radar system. In the synthetic aperture mode it is capable of imaging most of the Venus surface at a resolution of better than 300 m, approaching 120 m over more than half the planet. In the altimeter mode it will determine topographic relief to a vertical accuracy of better than 50 m averaged over a surface resolution cell approximately 10 km in diameter where the surface relief is not too extreme. In the radiometer mode the radar receiver can determine the surface radio emission brightness temperature with an absolute accuracy of 20 K, at a resolution of 2 K. Tracking of the orbiter's coherent radio telemetry transmitter will permit observations of small accelerations related to gravitational inhomogeneities in the planet's interior. Objectives of the mission include deducing the geological history of the surface and the geophysical state of the interior. Specific attention focuses on the origin, present distribution, and activity of four geological processes that modify the surface: (1) volcanic and tectonic; (2) impact; (3) erosional, depositional, and chemical; and (4) isostatic and convective. Data products resulting from the mission will be made available to members of the scientific community through NASA's Planetary Data System.},

abstract = "The 2015 New Horizons flyby through the Pluto system produced the first high-resolution topographic maps of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of the illuminated surface of Pluto's large icy moon Charon have been produced using both framing camera and line scan camera data (including four-color images at up to 1.47 km pixel scales), showing the best resolution data at all areas of the surface. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with vertical precisions of up to ∼0.1 km were constructed for ∼40\% of Charon using stereo imagery. Local radii estimates for the surface were also determined from the cartographic control network solution for the LORRI framing camera data, which validate the stereo solutions. Charon is moderately cratered, the largest of which is ∼250-km across and ∼6 km deep. Charon has a topographic range over the observed hemisphere from lowest to highest of ∼19 km, the largest topographic amplitude of any mid-sized icy body (including Ceres) other than Iapetus. Unlike Saturn's icy moons whose topographic signature is dominated by global relaxation of topography and subsequent impact cratering, large-scale tectonics and regional resurfacing dominate Charon's topography. Most of Charon's encounter hemisphere north of the equator (Oz Terra) is broken into large polygonal blocks by a network of wide troughs with typically 3–6 km relief; the deepest of these occur near the illuminated pole and are up to 13 km deep with respect to the global mean radius, the deepest known surfaces on Charon. The edge of this terrain is defined by large tilted blocks sloping ∼5° or so, the crests of which rise to 5 or 6 km above Charon mean, the highest known points on Charon. The southern resurfaced plains, Vulcan Planitia, consist of rolling plains, locally fractured and pitted, that are depressed ∼1 km below the mean elevation of the disrupted northern terrains of Oz Terra that comprise much of the northern hemisphere (but ∼2–2.5 km below the surfaces of the blocks themselves). These plains roll downward gently to the south with a topographic range of ∼5 km. The outer margins of Vulcan Planitia along the boundary with Oz Terra form a 2-3-km-deep trough, suggesting viscous flow along the outer margins. Isolated massifs 2–4 km high, also flanked by annular moats, lie within the planitia itself. The plains may be formed from volcanic resurfacing of cryogenic fluids, but the tilted blocks along the outer margins and the isolated and tilted massifs within Vulcan Planitia also suggest that much of Charon has been broken into large blocks, some of which have been rotated and some of which have foundered into Charon's upper “mantle”, now exposed as Vulcan Planitia, a history that may be most similar to the disrupted terrains of Ariel."

abstract = "This work presents the coregistered, orthorectified and mosaiced high-resolution products of the MC11 quadrangle of Mars, which have been processed using novel, fully automatic, techniques. We discuss the development of a pipeline that achieves fully automatic and parameter independent geometric alignment of high-resolution planetary images, starting from raw input images in NASA PDS format and following all required steps to produce a coregistered geotiff image, a corresponding footprint and useful metadata. Additionally, we describe the development of a radiometric calibration technique that post-processes coregistered images to make them radiometrically consistent. Finally, we present a batch-mode application of the developed techniques over the MC11 quadrangle to validate their potential, as well as to generate end products, which are released to the planetary science community, thus assisting in the analysis of Mars static and dynamic features. This case study is a step towards the full automation of signal processing tasks that are essential to increase the usability of planetary data, but currently, require the extensive use of human resources."

	Abstract = {The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, launched on August 3, 2004, is nearing the halfway point on its voyage to become the first probe to orbit the planet Mercury. The mission, spacecraft, and payload are designed to answer six fundamental questions regarding the innermost planet: (1) What planetary formational processes led to Mercury's high ratio of metal to silicate? (2) What is the geological history of Mercury? (3) What are the nature and origin of Mercury's magnetic field? (4) What are the structure and state of Mercury's core? (5) What are the radar-reflective materials at Mercury's poles? (6) What are the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near Mercury? The mission has focused to date on commissioning the spacecraft and science payload as well as planning for flyby and orbital operations. The second Venus flyby (June 2007) will complete final rehearsals for the Mercury flyby operations in January and October 2008 and September 2009. Those flybys will provide opportunities to image the hemisphere of the planet not seen by Mariner 10, obtain high-resolution spectral observations with which to map surface mineralogy and assay the exosphere, and carry out an exploration of the magnetic field and energetic particle distribution in the near-Mercury environment. The orbital phase, beginning on March 18, 2011, is a one-year-long, near-polar-orbital observational campaign that will address all mission goals. The orbital phase will complete global imaging, yield detailed surface compositional and topographic data over the northern hemisphere, determine the geometry of Mercury's internal magnetic field and magnetosphere, ascertain the radius and physical state of Mercury's outer core, assess the nature of Mercury's polar deposits, and inventory exospheric neutrals and magnetospheric charged particle species over a range of dynamic conditions. Answering the questions that have guided the MESSENGER mission will expand our understanding of the formation and evolution of the terrestrial planets as a family.},

abstract = "The 2015 New Horizons flyby has produced the first high-resolution maps of morphology and topography of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of Pluto were produced using both LORRI framing camera and MVIC line scan camera data, showing the best resolution data obtained for all areas of the illuminated surface, ∼78\% of the body. A unique feature of the Pluto imaging data set is the observation of terrains illuminated only by light scattered from atmospheric haze, allowing us to map terrains in the southern hemisphere that would otherwise have been in darkness. MVIC 4-color data were combined with the panchromatic map to produce full color global maps. Digital elevation models (DEMs) over ∼42\% of Pluto were produced using combinations of MVIC hemispheric scans and LORRI mosaics, from which slopes at scales of ∼1 km can be determined. Pluto can be divided into regions each with distinct topographic signatures, corresponding with major physiographic terrain types. Large areas of Pluto are comprised of low-relief moderately cratered plains units. Deeply pitted and glaciated plains east of Sputnik Planitia are elevated ∼0.7 km. The most dominant topographic feature on Pluto is the 1200-by-2000-km wide depression enclosing the bright Sputnik Planitia ice sheet, the surface of which is 2.5-to-3.5 km deep (relative to the rim) and ∼2 km deep relative to the mean radius. The partial ring of steep-sided massifs, several of which are more than 5 km high, along the western margins of Sputnik Planitia produce some of the locally highest and steepest relief on Pluto, with slopes of 40–50°. The second major topographic feature is a complex, eroded, ridge-trough system ∼300–400 km wide and at least 3200 km long extending north-to-south along the 155° meridian. This enormous structure has several kilometers of relief. It may predate the large impact event forming the basin, though some post-Sputnik Planitia deformation is evident. The large depressed, partially walled plain, Hyecho Palus, lies due southwest of Sputnik Planitia. Near the center of Hyecho Palus lie the circular constructional edifices Wright and Piccard Montes. Wright Mons rises 4.5 km above these plains, with a central depression ∼4.5 km deep, whereas Piccard Mons, best observed in haze-light, rises ∼5.5 km above the plains but has a bowl-shaped central depression ∼5.5 km below the plains for a total relief of up to 11 km, the greatest observed on Pluto. Both of these features are interpreted as constructional (volcanic?) in nature. Additional prominent topographic features include a 2–3 km high and ∼600 km wide dome centered on the illuminated IAU pole and the amoeboidal plateaus of “bladed” terrains in the equatorial region, which rise 2–5 km above local terrains and are the highest standing geologic units on the encounter hemisphere. The mean elevations in the integrated DEM for the two radio occultation areas are consistent with the 5–6 km difference in elevation as determined independently by the radio experiment, and a limb profile near the egress point confirms the presence of elevated bladed terrains in that area. Local relief of 3–5 km at massifs, troughs and pits supports conclusions that the icy shell of Pluto is relatively rigid. Numerous examples of topographic control of ice or frost deposition occur across Pluto, including the distinct coloration of the polar dome, the elevated terrains of eastern Tombaugh Regio, and along the ridge-trough system, where ridge tops and fossae rims are covered in different ices than at lower elevations. The topographic hypsogram of Pluto's encounter hemisphere is strongly bimodal due to the large Sputnik Planitia depression. Otherwise the topographic signature of Pluto is controlled by deviations from the otherwise dominant low plains, including elevated bladed terrain plateaus and the depressed volcanic province including Wright and Piccard Montes."

	Abstract = {We describe a procedure that allows the efficient generation of numerical shape models for irregular Solar System objects, where a numerical model is simply a table of evenly spaced body-centered latitudes and longitudes and their associated radii. This modeling technique uses a combination of data from limbs, terminators, and control points, and produces shape models that have some important advantages over analytical shape models. Accurate numerical shape models make it feasible to study irregular objects with a wide range of standard scientific analysis techniques. These applications include the determination of moments of inertia and surface gravity, the mapping of surface locations and structural orientations, photometric measurement and analysis, the reprojection and mosaicking of digital images, and the generation of albedo maps. The capabilities of our modeling procedure are illustrated through the development of an accurate numerical shape model for Phobos and the production of a global, high-resolution, high-pass-filtered digital image mosaic of this Martian moon. Other irregular objects that have been modeled, or are being modeled, include the asteroid Gaspra and the satellites Deimos, Amalthea, Epimetheus, Janus, Hyperion, and Proteus.},

(p. 214, published online 21 March) present the most recent determination of Mercury{\textquoteright}s gravity field, based on radio tracking of the MESSENGER spacecraft between 18 March and 23 August 2011. The results point to an interior structure that differs from those of the other terrestrial planets: the density of the planet{\textquoteright}s solid outer shell suggests the existence of a deep reservoir of high-density material, possibly an Fe-S layer. Zuber et al. (p. 217, published online 21 March) used data obtained by the MESSENGER laser altimeter through to 24 October 2011 to build a topographic map of Mercury{\textquoteright}s northern hemisphere. The map shows less variation in elevation, compared with Mars or the Moon, and its features add to the body of evidence that Mercury has sustained geophysical activity for much of its history.Radio tracking of the MESSENGER spacecraft has provided a model of Mercury{\textquoteright}s gravity field. In the northern hemisphere, several large gravity anomalies, including candidate mass concentrations (mascons), exceed 100 milli-Galileos (mgal). Mercury{\textquoteright}s northern hemisphere crust is thicker at low latitudes and thinner in the polar region and shows evidence for thinning beneath some impact basins. The low-degree gravity field, combined with planetary spin parameters, yields the moment of inertia C/MR2 = 0.353 {\textpm} 0.017, where M and R are Mercury{\textquoteright}s mass and radius, and a ratio of the moment of inertia of Mercury{\textquoteright}s solid outer shell to that of the planet of Cm/C = 0.452 {\textpm} 0.035. A model for Mercury{\textquoteright}s radial density distribution consistent with these results includes a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid iron-sulfide layer and an iron-rich liquid outer core and perhaps a solid inner core.},

	Abstract = {In June 2009 the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft was launched to the Moon. The payload consists of 7 science instruments selected to characterize sites for future robotic and human missions. Among them, the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) was designed to obtain altimetry, surface roughness, and reflectance measurements. The primary phase of lunar exploration lasted one year, following a 3-month commissioning phase. On completion of its exploration objectives, the LRO mission transitioned to a science mission. After 7 years in lunar orbit, the LOLA instrument continues to map the lunar surface. The LOLA dataset is one of the foundational datasets acquired by the various LRO instruments. LOLA provided a high-accuracy global geodetic reference frame to which past, present and future lunar observations can be referenced. It also obtained high-resolution and accurate global topography that were used to determine regions in permanent shadow at the lunar poles. LOLA further contributed to the study of polar volatiles through its unique measurement of surface brightness at zero phase, which revealed anomalies in several polar craters that may indicate the presence of water ice. In this paper, we describe the many LOLA accomplishments to date and its contribution to lunar and planetary science.},

@article{Spencer:2020sci,
	Abstract = {The New Horizons spacecraft flew past the Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth (also known as 2014 MU69) in January 2019. Because of the great distance to the outer Solar System and limited bandwidth, it will take until late 2020 to downlink all the spacecraft{\textquoteright}s observations back to Earth. Three papers in this issue analyze recently downlinked data, including the highest-resolution images taken during the encounter (see the Perspective by Jewitt). Spencer et al. examined Arrokoth{\textquoteright}s geology and geophysics using stereo imaging, dated the surface using impact craters, and produced a geomorphological map. Grundy et al. investigated the composition of the surface using color imaging and spectroscopic data and assessed Arrokoth{\textquoteright}s thermal emission using microwave radiometry. McKinnon et al. used simulations to determine how Arrokoth formed: Two gravitationally bound objects gently spiraled together during the formation of the Solar System. Together, these papers determine the age, composition, and formation process of the most pristine object yet visited by a spacecraft.Science, this issue p. eaay3999, p. eaay3705, p. eaay6620; see also p. 980INTRODUCTIONOn 1 January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft passed 3538 km from Kuiper Belt object (KBO) (486958) Arrokoth. Arrokoth is a contact binary consisting of two distinct lobes, connected by a narrow neck. Its orbital parameters, albedo, and color make Arrokoth a typical cold classical KBO (CCKBO). CCKBOs are the most dynamically and physically primitive population of small Solar System bodies known.RATIONALESince the publication of initial results from the flyby, additional data have been downlinked and analyzed. This paper describes the resulting analysis of Arrokoth{\textquoteright}s shape, geological evolution, and satellite and ring constraints.RESULTSImproved stereo imaging constrains the object{\textquoteright}s shape and topography and allows us to generate a stereographic terrain model. Typical relief on both lobes (away from the neck region) is ~0.5 km or smaller.Arrokoth{\textquoteright}s rotational period is 15.92 {\textpm} 0.02 hours, with its rotational pole pointing to right ascension = 317.5 {\textpm} 1{\textdegree}, declination = -24.9 {\textpm} 1{\textdegree}, J2000 equinox. The object consists of two roughly ellipsoidal lobes with overall dimensions of 36 km by 20 km by 10 km. The maximum dimensions of the two lobes are 20.6 km by 19.9 km by 9.4 km and 15.4 km by 13.8 km by 9.8 km, with uncertainties of 0.5 km by 0.5 km by 2.0 km. The total volume is equal to a sphere of diameter 18.3 {\textpm} 1.2 km, and the volume ratio of the two lobes is 1.9 {\textpm} 0.5. Global bulk density must be \&gt;290 kg m-3 if the neck is not in tension. Assuming a bulk density of 500 kg m-3, as measured for comets, the mean surface gravity is ~1 mm s-2, and the compressive strength of the neck must be \&gt;2.3 kPa.The two lobes are closely aligned. The maximum axis of inertia of the large lobe is aligned within \&lt;5{\textdegree} of that of the small lobe. The equatorial planes of the two lobes are also almost coincident in space.The small lobe{\textquoteright}s surface is marked by complex albedo patterns, often with sinuous margins and no detectable topographic signature, whereas the large lobe{\textquoteright}s surface is dominated by clusters of low dark hills superposed on brighter, smoother terrain. The large lobe{\textquoteright}s surface is divided into distinct subunits, which may represent smaller bodies that accreted to form it, though the overall smoothness of the surface, and the youthful appearance of many boundaries, which are sometimes undetectable or cross-cut by clusters of hills, suggest a more complex postformation history. If the subunits did accrete first, the smoothness of their mutual boundaries suggests subsequent accretion of additional material and later reactivation of the boundaries.We identify ~40 possible impact craters on Arrokoth, though only about 10 with high confidence. The largest crater, nicknamed Maryland, is about 7 km in diameter, and the rest are smaller than 1 km. Their size-frequency distribution is consistent with a single power law. Crater densities are lower than on many other small bodies but are consistent with a surface age of \&gt;4 billion years. No satellites or rings are detected: Satellite diameter upper limit is 180 m out to 8000-km radius from Arrokoth.CONCLUSIONArrokoth{\textquoteright}s smooth, lightly cratered surface is unlike that of other Solar System bodies and appears to date from the period of planetary accretion. The alignment of its two lobes constrains the processes that formed this contact binary. Because its orbit, albedo, color, and rotation are typical of other CCKBOs, Arrokoth can likely be used to understand the cold classical belt as a whole.Stereo image pair of Arrokoth.The left and center images can be viewed cross-eyed, or the right and center by direct viewing.The Cold Classical Kuiper Belt, a class of small bodies in undisturbed orbits beyond Neptune, is composed of primitive objects preserving information about Solar System formation. In January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past one of these objects, the 36-kilometer-long contact binary (486958) Arrokoth (provisional designation 2014 MU69). Images from the flyby show that Arrokoth has no detectable rings, and no satellites (larger than 180 meters in diameter) within a radius of 8000 kilometers. Arrokoth has a lightly cratered, smooth surface with complex geological features, unlike those on previously visited Solar System bodies. The density of impact craters indicates the surface dates from the formation of the Solar System. The two lobes of the contact binary have closely aligned poles and equators, constraining their accretion mechanism.},

	abstract = {The flyby of Pluto and its moon Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft generated news coverage around the world. Now Stern et al. report the first scientific results from the high-speed encounter. The surface of Pluto is surprisingly diverse, with large regions of differing brightness and composition. There is ample evidence for ongoing rich geological processes that act to sculpt its surface. Charon{\textquoteright}s surface is similarly complex, with numerous relief structures and varied coloration. Pluto{\textquoteright}s atmosphere is extensive but less dense than expected, whereas Charon has no detectable atmosphere.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad1815INTRODUCTIONPluto was discovered in 1930 and was long thought to be a misfit or anomaly in the solar system. However, the 1992 discovery of the Kuiper Belt{\textemdash}a torus-shaped region beyond Neptune{\textquoteright}s orbit, and the largest structure in our three-zoned planetary system{\textemdash}provided new context, showing Pluto to be the largest of a new class of small planets formed in the outer solar system during the ancient era of planetary accretion ~4.5 billion years ago. NASA{\textquoteright}s New Horizons spacecraft made the first exploration of Pluto, culminating on 14 July 2015; it collected numerous remote sensing and in situ measurements of Pluto and its system of five moons. We report the first scientific results and interpretations of that flyby.RATIONALEThe New Horizons spacecraft completed a close approach to the Pluto system at a distance of 13,691 km from Pluto{\textquoteright}s center. The spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of scientific instruments, including the Ralph multicolor/panchromatic mapper and mapping infrared composition spectrometer; the LORRI long-focal-length panchromatic visible imager; the Alice extreme/far ultraviolet mapping spectrograph; twin REX radio science experiments; the SWAP solar wind detector; the PEPSSI high-energy charged particle spectrometer; and VBSDC, a dust impact detector. Together these instruments collected more than 50 gigabits of data on the Pluto system near the time of the spacecraft{\textquoteright}s closest approach.RESULTSWe found that Pluto{\textquoteright}s surface displays a wide variety of landforms and terrain ages, as well as substantial albedo, color, and compositional variation. Evidence was also found for a water ice{\textendash}rich crust, geologically young surface units, tectonic extension, surface volatile ice convection, possible wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto{\textquoteright}s atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. The bulk densities of Pluto and Charon were found to differ by less than 10\%, which is consistent with bulk rock contents for the two bodies that are likewise similar. This could imply that both precursor bodies were undifferentiated (or only modestly differentiated) prior to their collision{\textemdash}which would have profound implications for the timing, the duration, and even the mechanism of accretion in the ancestral Kuiper Belt.Pluto{\textquoteright}s large moon Charon displays extensional tectonics and extensive resurfacing, as well as possible evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. The sizes of Pluto{\textquoteright}s small satellites Nix and Hydra were measured for the first time, as were their surface reflectivities, which are puzzlingly higher than Charon{\textquoteright}s. No new satellites were detected.CONCLUSIONThe New Horizons encounter revealed that Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms, including those resulting from glaciological and surface-atmosphere interactions as well as impact, tectonic, possible cryovolcanic, and mass-wasting processes. This suggests that other small planets of the Kuiper Belt, such as Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, could express similarly complex histories that rival those of terrestrial planets. Pluto{\textquoteright}s diverse surface geology and long-term activity also raise fundamental questions about how it has remained active many billions of years after its formation.Pluto mosaic made from New Horizons LORRI images taken 14 July 2015 from a distance of 80,000 km.This view is projected from a point 1800 km above Pluto{\textquoteright}s equator, looking northeast over the dark, cratered, informally named Cthulhu Regio toward the bright, smooth expanse of icy plains informally called Sputnik Planum. Pluto{\textquoteright}s north pole is off the image to the left. This image mosaic was produced with panchromatic images from the New Horizons LORRI camera, with color overlaid from the Ralph color mapper onboard New Horizons.The Pluto system was recently explored by NASA{\textquoteright}s New Horizons spacecraft, making closest approach on 14 July 2015. Pluto{\textquoteright}s surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto{\textquoteright}s atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto{\textquoteright}s diverse surface geology and long-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years after formation. Pluto{\textquoteright}s large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected.},

We describe the technique and present maps of the co-located data sets. A global map and regional maps of Xanadu and the northern hemisphere hydrocarbon lakes district are included in the results. A strength of the technique is that it provides topographic information co-located with SAR imagery. Having a topographic context vastly improves the interpretability of the SAR imagery and is essential for understanding Titan. SARTopo is capable of estimating surface heights for most of the SAR-imaged surface of Titan. Currently nearly 30% of the surface is within 100 km of a SARTopo height profile. Other competing techniques provide orders of magnitude less coverage. We validate the SARTopo technique through comparison with known geomorphological features such as mountain ranges and craters, and by comparison with co-located nadir altimetry, including a 3000 km strip that had been observed by SAR a month earlier. In this area, the SARTopo and nadir altimetry data sets are co-located tightly (within 5–10 km for one 500 km section), have similar resolution, and as expected agree closely in surface height. Furthermore the region contains prominent high spatial resolution topography, so it provides an excellent test of the resolution and precision of both techniques."

Circular depressions show geographical variation in their forms and suggest differences in erosion rates or style over scales >1 km. The stratigraphic arrangement of these features suggests that the comet experienced substantial periods of little erosion. Smooth surfaces trending downslope suggest some form of eruption of materials from this highly porous object. The Deep Impact images show that the nucleus of Tempel 1 cannot be modeled simply as either an onion-layer or rubble pile structure."

	Abstract = {During its tour of the Saturn system, Cassini performed two close flybys of Rhea dedicated to gravity investigations, the first in November 2005 and the second in March 2013. This paper presents an estimation of Rhea's fully unconstrained quadrupole gravity field obtained from a joint multi-arc analysis of the two Cassini flybys. Our best estimates of the main gravity quadrupole unnormalized coefficients are J2×106=946.0$\pm$13.9, C22×106=242.1$\pm$4.0 (uncertainties are 1-σ). Their resulting ratio is J2/C22=3.91$\pm$0.10, statistically not compatible (at a 5-σ level) with the theoretical value of 10/3, predicted for a hydrostatic satellite in slow, synchronous rotation around a planet. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the moment of inertia factor directly using the Radau--Darwin approximation. The observed excess J2 (gravity oblateness) was investigated using a combined analysis of gravity and topography, under different plausible geophysical assumptions. The observed gravity is consistent with that generated by the observed shape for an undifferentiated (uniform density) body. However, because the surface is more likely to be water ice, a two-layer model may be a better approximation. In this case, and assuming a mantle density of 920kg/m3, some 1--3km of excess core oblateness is consistent with the observed gravity. A wide range of moments of inertia is allowed, but models with low moments of inertia (i.e., more differentiation) require greater magnitudes of excess core topography to satisfy the observations.},

We consider the correlation of swells to volcano concentrations and basins to mountain concentrations, to imply a heat flow distribution across Io that is consistent with the asthenospheric tidal heating model of Tackley et al. (2001). The stereo DEM reveals topographic signatures of regional-scale features including Loki Patera, Ra Patera, and the Tvashtar Paterae complex, in addition to previously unrecognized features including an ~1000 km diameter depression and a >2000 km long topographic arc comprising mountainous and layered plains material.},

@article{Zannoni:2020icarus,
	Abstract = {During its mission in the Saturn system, Cassini performed five close flybys of Dione. During three of them, radio tracking data were collected during the closest approach, allowing estimation of the full degree-2 gravity field by precise spacecraft orbit determination. The gravity field of Dione is dominated by J2 and C22, for which our best estimates are J2 × 106 = 1496 $\pm$ 11 and C22 × 106 = 364.8 $\pm$ 1.8 (unnormalized coefficients, 1-σ uncertainty). Their ratio is J2/C22 = 4.102 $\pm$ 0.044, showing a significative departure (about 17-σ) from the theoretical value of 10/3, predicted for a relaxed body in slow, synchronous rotation around a planet. Therefore, it is not possible to retrieve the moment of inertia directly from the measured gravitational field. The interior structure of Dione is investigated by a combined analysis of its gravity and topography, which exhibits an even larger deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium, suggesting some degree of compensation. The gravity of Dione is far from the expectation for an undifferentiated hydrostatic body, so we built a series of three-layer models, and considered both Airy and Pratt compensation mechanisms. The interpretation is non-unique, but Dione's excess topography may suggest some degree of Airy-type isostasy, meaning that the outer ice shell is underlain by a higher density, lower viscosity layer, such as a subsurface liquid water ocean. The data permit a broad range of possibilities, but the best fitting models tend towards large shell thicknesses and small ocean thicknesses.},

abstract = "The Cassini spacecraft has acquired 25 radar altimeter elevation profiles along Titan's surface as of April 2008, and we have analyzed 18 of these for which there are currently reconstructed ephemeris data. Altimeter measurements were collected at spatial footprint sizes from 6–60 km along ground tracks of length 400–3600 km. The elevation profiles yield topographic information at this resolution with a statistical height accuracy of 35–50 m and kilometer-scale errors several times greater. The data exhibit significant variations in terrain, from flat regions with little topographic expression to very rugged Titanscapes. The bandwidth of the transmitted waveform admits vertical resolution of the terrain height to 35 m at each observed location on the surface. Variations in antenna pointing and changes in surface statistics cause the range-compressed radar echoes to exhibit strong systematic and time-variable biases of hundreds of meters in delay. It is necessary to correct the received echoes for these changes, and we have derived correction algorithms such that the derived echo profiles are accurate at the 100 m level for off-nadir pointing errors of 0.3° and 0.6°, for leading edge and echo centroid estimators, respectively. The leading edge of the echo yields the elevation of the highest points on the surface, which we take to be the peaks of any terrain variation. The mean value of the echo delay is more representative of the mean elevation, so that the difference of these values gives an estimate of any local mountain heights. Finding locations where these values diverge indicates higher-relief terrain. Elevation features are readily seen in the height profiles. Several of the passes show mountains of several hundred m altitude, spread over 10's or even 100's of km in spatial extent, so that slopes are very small. Large expanses of sub-100 m topography are commonplace on Titan, so it is rather smooth in many locations. Other areas exhibit more relief, although the overall observed variation in surface height on any pass is less than about 1 km. Some elevation features correspond to observed changes in brightness in Cassini infrared images, but many do not. Correspondence between the imaging SAR ground tracks and the altimeter paths is limited, so that identifying elevation changes with higher resolution SAR features is premature at present."

abstract = {This study attempts to develop a method for the simulation of surface flow paths on a digital elevation model (DEM). The objective is to use a facet-based algorithm to estimate the surface flow paths on a raster DEM. A grid DEM was used to create a triangular facet network (TFN) over which the surface flow paths were determined. Since each facet in the network has a constant slope and aspect, the estimations of, for example, flow direction and divergence/convergence are less complicated compared to traditional raster-based solutions. Experiments were undertaken by estimating the specific catchment area (SCA) over a number of mathematical surfaces, as well as on a real-world DEM. Comparisons were made between the derived SCA by the TFN algorithm with some algorithms reported in the literature. The results show that the TFN algorithm produced the closest outcomes to the theoretical values of the SCA compared with other algorithms, deriving more consistent outcomes and being less influenced by surface shapes. The real-world DEM test also shows that the TFN was capable of modeling flow distribution without noticeable “artifacts,” and its ability of tracking flow paths makes it an appropriate platform for dynamic surface flow simulation.},

Zuber et al. (p. 217, published online 21 March) used data obtained by the MESSENGER laser altimeter through to 24 October 2011 to build a topographic map of Mercury{\textquoteright}s northern hemisphere. The map shows less variation in elevation, compared with Mars or the Moon, and its features add to the body of evidence that Mercury has sustained geophysical activity for much of its history.Laser altimetry by the MESSENGER spacecraft has yielded a topographic model of the northern hemisphere of Mercury. The dynamic range of elevations is considerably smaller than those of Mars or the Moon. The most prominent feature is an extensive lowland at high northern latitudes that hosts the volcanic northern plains. Within this lowland is a broad topographic rise that experienced uplift after plains emplacement. The interior of the 1500-km-diameter Caloris impact basin has been modified so that part of the basin floor now stands higher than the rim. The elevated portion of the floor of Caloris appears to be part of a quasi-linear rise that extends for approximately half the planetary circumference at mid-latitudes. Collectively, these features imply that long-wavelength changes to Mercury{\textquoteright}s topography occurred after the earliest phases of the planet{\textquoteright}s geological history.},

	abstract = {Spacecraft-to-spacecraft tracking observations from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) have been used to construct a gravitational field of the Moon to spherical harmonic degree and order 420. The GRAIL field reveals features not previously resolved, including tectonic structures, volcanic landforms, basin rings, crater central peaks, and numerous simple craters. From degrees 80 through 300, over 98\% of the gravitational signature is associated with topography, a result that reflects the preservation of crater relief in highly fractured crust. The remaining 2\% represents fine details of subsurface structure not previously resolved. GRAIL elucidates the role of impact bombardment in homogenizing the distribution of shallow density anomalies on terrestrial planetary bodies.},

abstract = {The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is the latest addition to the suite of missions on or orbiting Mars as part of the NASA Mars Exploration Program. Launched on 12 August 2005, the orbiter successfully entered Mars orbit on 10 March 2006 and finished aerobraking on 30 August 2006. Now in its near-polar, near-circular, low-altitude (∼300 km), 3 p.m. orbit, the spacecraft is operating its payload of six scientific instruments throughout a one-Mars-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) of global mapping, regional survey, and targeted observations. Eight scientific investigations were chosen for MRO, two of which use either the spacecraft accelerometers or tracking of the spacecraft telecom signal to acquire data needed for analysis. Six instruments, including three imaging systems, a visible-near infrared spectrometer, a shallow-probing subsurface radar, and a thermal-infrared profiler, were selected to complement and extend the capabilities of current working spacecraft at Mars. Whether observing the atmosphere, surface, or subsurface, the MRO instruments are designed to achieve significantly higher resolution while maintaining coverage comparable to the current best observations. The requirements to return higher-resolution data, to target routinely from a low-altitude orbit, and to operate a complex suite of instruments were major challenges successfully met in the design and build of the spacecraft, as well as by the mission design. Calibration activities during the seven-month cruise to Mars and limited payload operations during a three-day checkout prior to the start of aerobraking demonstrated, where possible, that the spacecraft and payload still had the functions critical to the science mission. Two critical events, the deployment of the SHARAD radar antenna and the opening of the CRISM telescope cover, were successfully accomplished in September 2006. Normal data collection began 7 November 2006 after solar conjunction. As part of its science mission, MRO will also aid identification and characterization of the most promising sites for future landed missions, both in terms of safety and in terms of the scientific potential for future discovery. Ultimately, MRO data will advance our understanding of how Mars has evolved and by which processes that change occurs, all within a framework of identifying the presence, extent, and role of water in shaping the planet's climate over time.},
